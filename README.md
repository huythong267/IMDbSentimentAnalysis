# IMDb Sentiment Analysis
I wrote this code for IMDB sentiment analysis for the ECE6254 Statistical Machine Learning project. I used RNN and CNN model to predict the sentiment of the IMDB review. After the neural net is trained, the Word Embedding layer is extracted to analyse what is learned by the deep net.
